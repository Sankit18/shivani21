      <h2>I can hardly remember the first day we met, <br>
        Wasn’t the best one would expect.<br>
        It’s funny to think back to that time,<br>
        When talking to you was never on my mind.<br>
        With your attitude and my Strictness to kick-off,<br>
        Later balancing formal informal talks as on and off,<br>
        We surely came a long way if you think,<br>
        But then again that’s not your thing,<br>
        Neither u nor me would have this dream,<br>
        But we ended up being more than an audit team.

      <h3>A pure soul and a special friend ,<br>
        Time (Fooling, Flirting) with you is what I love to spend,<br>
        Even during work from home,<br>
        Irritating me is your only norm,<br>
        Most of which are through your meme bomb,<br>
        But with a smile which is nothing but warm.<br>
      </h3>

      <img class="shivani4" src="images/shivani4.jpeg" alt="shivanipic">
      <h4>You introduced me to my extro version, <br>
        With you I am totally a different person,<br>
        Like casting a magic spell of ultimate comfort zone,<br>
        In which I act cool or fool, I know I am not alone.<br>
        I know I never said it nor I may have ever shown,<br>
        But In ur zone my fun side even little has always grown
      </h4>

      <img class="shivani5" src="images/shivani5.jpeg" alt="shivanipic">
      <h5>Only if this world had more people like you,<br>
        It would certainly be a better place.<br>
        With time, in different ways we will be in touch,<br>
        but I would miss our current times very much,<br>
        I’ll always think of our moments,<br>
        Which will always bring me a smile,<br>
        One that would always remind me,<br>
        To smile and face darkness in your unique style.
      </h5>

      <h6>A meme addict yet you are a saving friend,<br>
        A consoling hug is what I like to send.<br>
        Like Chadi Buddies we haven’t been through thick and thin,<br>
        But that doesn’t mean my shoulders are not for you to lean.<br>
        Now listen you bitch, you are my coolest friend,<br>
        All Problems big o small u’ll have to first defend,<br>
        I walked and realised we all have to cover our own ground,<br>
        And that’s why I wont promise to be always around,<br>
        But when tired don’t forget to ping or call for a helping hand,<br>
        Because Shivani, unlike avenger this our start and not the end.

      <h7>Finally wish you many many happy returns of the day. Have a great and peaceful year ahead and safe one too.
         You are blessed with unique power of being simple, lively and excited.
         You have the ability to shed light in others darkness without even knowing yourself.
         Lift others with your liveliness and happy go lucky attitude.
         When you are down others want to leave their darkness aside and want to lift you up.
        The best part is you help others even without trying to. So I pray you grow in all areas of your life but don’t lose your essence of being yourself and happy and smiling the way you are.
